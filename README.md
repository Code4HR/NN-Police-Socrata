# NN-Police-Socrata
Gathers Newport News Police Open Data for syndication to Socrata. This is currently a prototype as a potential solution to [NDoCH-207 Issue #5](https://github.com/Code4HR/NDoCH-2017/issues/5) 

>Crime data from Newport News is published online as downloadable CSV. Syndicating into Socrata would make it more accessible.
